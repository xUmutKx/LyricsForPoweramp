# Usage Instructions

No changes are required in Poweramp settings to use this app.

This app is a lyrics plugin, not a standalone lyrics app.
You cannot directly view lyrics in this plugin or select it as a _Preferred Lyrics App_ in Poweramp
settings.

Poweramp automatically sends a lyrics request when it doesn't have lyrics available for a track.

- #### App settings

    - #### Theme
      You can manually change the app's theme.
      Devices running Android 10+ can choose system default mode to follow system theme.

    - #### Lyrics Request.

        - #### Fallback to Search Method
          If the plugin
          cannot [find the best match](https://lrclib.net/docs#:~:text=Get%20lyrics%20with%20a%20track's%20signature),
          it will fallback to
          a [search method](https://lrclib.net/docs#:~:text=Search%20for%20lyrics%20records), which
          may occasionally retrieve incorrect lyrics.

        - #### Notify on Lyrics Request Failure
          If the lyrics request fails, the app posts a notification. From this notification, you can
          launch the plugin prepopulated with track metadata to perform a manual search and update
          the lyrics.

        - #### Replace previous notification
          Enabling this option replaces the previous notification with a new one, preventing the
          notification panel from being flooded with failure notifications.
          However, this means you can perform a manual search only for the most recent failed track.

        - #### Preferred Lyrics Type
          Choose whether the app should always try to send synced or plain lyrics to Poweramp.
          If the chosen type is not available for a track, the other type will be sent if available.

        - #### Mark Instrumental Songs
          There are non-vocal music tracks, also known as instrumental songs.
          If no lyrics are set for these tracks, Poweramp will prompt for lyrics every time
          you open the lyrics UI while playing them.
          This option will set dummy lyrics for instrumental tracks, preventing the lyrics request
          from appearing.
          This option is only applicable to Poweramp cached lyrics.

    - #### Lyrics Storage Settings
       
       - #### Send Lyrics to Poweramp
          [Recommended to keep enabled always]

          The result will be sent to Poweramp and cached in Poweramp's internal memory.
          Advantages:
            * The lyrics will immediately appear in the Poweramp UI.
            * You can update lyrics directly from the Poweramp UI by launching the plugin using the ( :fast_forward: ) button.
          Disadvantages: 
            * Poweramp won't include these lyrics in its backup.
            * Poweramp gives lower priority to lyrics from the plugin and prefers lyrics from tags or files.
        
        - #### Save Lyrics as Files
           The lyrics will be stored in the same location as the music files.

          Advantages:
            * Lyrics will be preserved even if you perform a **Full Rescan** or **Reinstall Poweramp
              **
            * The lyrics may appear in other music players if they support displaying lyrics from
              files.

          Disadvantages:
          * There may be a delay in loading lyrics into the Poweramp UI. Sometimes, Poweramp
            requires a rescan or restart.
          * You can't easily change lyrics from the Poweramp UI.
          
          Tips for Selecting Folders:
          * When choosing a music folder, instead of selecting individual subfolders, try to select their parent folder.
          * You cannot select root directory of storage due to Android restrictions.

          #### Updating Lyrics Files on Github Version:
            1. Delete the existing lyrics file from storage.
            2. Play the track again in Poweramp with:
                  - [Send to Poweramp](#send-lyrics-to-poweramp) enabled
                  - [Save Lyrics as Files](#save-lyrics-as-files) disabled
            This will allow you to launch the plugin from Poweramp UI again.
            3. Before proceeding to search:
                  - Enable [Save Lyrics as Files](#save-lyrics-as-files)
                  - Disable [Send to Poweramp](#send-lyrics-to-poweramp) (if you don’t need it)
            4. Go back to the plugin’s main screen and start a new search.
            5. From the search results, carefully select the lyrics you want.
             
          #### Updating Lyrics Files on PlayStore Version:
          The Play Store version includes a Library Screen, allowing you to change lyrics anytime without changing playback or launching Poweramp.

  - #### Lyrics Editor
      - #### Translation Service API Keys
        You need to configure this field by entering API keys from your own account on the API
        provider's website. This allows the feature to remain free for everyone, as it avoids the
        need for me to pay for API usage and turn it into a paid feature. Your keys are stored only
        on your device.

      - #### API Providers
          - Google Gemini

            Get an API Key from here - https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey.
    - #### Filters
      You can specify filters for the title, artist, and album fields to remove matches from the
      corresponding search parameter.
      Filters can be strings or regular expressions.  
      For example, to exclude strings like `320kbps` from track title, enter `\d{3}kbps` in the
      title filter box. This will remove any such matches from the title.


- #### Search Modes

  The app offers two search options:

    * **Coarse Search**: Performs a keyword-based search that yields a broad range of results.
      This method sacrifices accuracy for quantity.

    * **Fine Search**: Focuses on specific fields such as track title, artist name, and album name.
      It provides more relevant results but limits the number of matches returned.
